# Indian-Sign-Lang-Recognition
Indian sign language recognition system- A group of indicators that communicate a message through predetermined gestures and motions. 
Convolution neural network (CNN) is a neural network technology that is used to train the required prediction models. Also created a GUI to display the output.

The Dataset that I have created to train:

Algorithm -

1. Collect a dataset of ISL gestures.
2. Preprocess the dataset by resizing the images, normalizing the pixel
values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. Build a CNN model with several convolutional and pooling layers,
followed by fully connected layers and a softmax output layer.
4. Train the CNN model on the training dataset.
5. Evaluate the performance of the CNN model on the testing dataset using
metrics such as loss, accuracy, val_loss and val_accuracy.
6. Fine-tune the CNN model by adjusting hyperparameters such as learning
rate, batch size, and number of layers.
7. Use the trained CNN model to predict the ISL gesture from new input
images.
8. Developed a GUI to view system output.



Output -
